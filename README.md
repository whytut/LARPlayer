Getting free audio books
------------------------

[Librivox](https://librivox.org/search) has a good list of free public domain audiobooks created by the community. To get their books in M4B format, look for the *Download M4B" link at the bottom of the left column.

You can create your own M4B files from other audio files (like MP3) using the excellent [AudiobookConverter](https://github.com/yermak/AudioBookConverter) or [M4B-Tool](https://github.com/sandreas/m4b-tool/tree/master) converters.


Planned features
----------------

- AudioBookShelf support

Troubleshooting
---------------

If LARK player doesn't start, try to start it from `kterm` and submit an issue with the error you get.

```
cd LARK
./start_lark.sh
```
Building
--------

You must create your CMake toolchain file for your cross-compile toolchain.

You also need to get libfaad2 libraries (`.so`) and include (`.h`) files or [build them from source](https://github.com/knik0/faad2).

```
git clone 
cd LARK
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=armhf-toolchain.cmake
